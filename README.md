# coursera_node
Aug 2018 

I am doing the Coursera course Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB from the University of Hong Kong.
It's the 5th part of a 5 course specialisation - full stack development using an angular front end and a node/mongodb backend.
I'm not much interested in the front end (at the moment) so I haven't done the first 4 courses.
